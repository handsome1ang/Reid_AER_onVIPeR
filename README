##INFORMATION:
This is the Matlab code of our work 
Zhaoju Li, Zhenjun Han, Qixiang Ye:"Person Re-identification via AdaBoost Ranking Ensemble". In ICIP 2016.
It has been conducted on Windows System, Ubuntu System untested. 
Two demos are provided:
- Ada_demo.m    : single experiment for validation
- Average_ada.m : ten trials of experiments for final evaluation.
